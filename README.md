What is OpenCV?

OpenCV is the huge open-source library for the computer vision, machine learning, and image processing and now it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in today’s systems. By using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even handwriting of a human. When it integrated with various libraries, such as NumPy, python is capable of processing the OpenCV array structure for analysis. To Identify image pattern and its various features we use vector space and perform mathematical operations on these features. 


Give some examples of OpenCV usage.
There are lots of applications which are solved using OpenCV, some of them are listed below 

face recognition
Automated inspection and surveillance
number of people – count (foot traffic in a mall, etc)
Vehicle counting on highways along with their speeds
Interactive art installations
Anomaly (defect) detection in the manufacturing process (the odd defective products)
Street view image stitching
Video/image search and retrieval
Robot and driver-less car navigation and control
object recognition
Medical image analysis
Movies – 3D structure from motion
TV Channels advertisement recognition

OpenCV Functionality 
 

Image/video I/O, processing, display (core, imgproc, highgui)
Object/feature detection (objdetect, features2d, nonfree)
Geometry-based monocular or stereo computer vision (calib3d, stitching, videostab)
Computational photography (photo, video, superres)
Machine learning & clustering (ml, flann)
CUDA acceleration (gpu)
